# xrstf KiCad Library

This repository contains my tweaks and custom footprints for
KiCad 5.x.

## Usage

Clone it somewhere and add it to the symbol and footprint libraries
in your local KiCad installation.

Next, via `Preferences > Configure Paths...` add a new path variable
named `KICAD_XRSTF_LIBRARY` and point it to the root path of your
repository clone.
